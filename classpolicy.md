#### Attendance Policy

**Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(2 weeks) result in a failing grade for the course.**  To excuse your absences, **a proper document with early notice** is necessary. Two late marks count as one absence. If students leave early with early notice, I will consider as one late mark.

#### No SNS and phone policy
Please, silence your cellphone and other electronic devices. Except early notice, do not use SNS or phone.
**For the quiz and test, students should turn off their electronic devices and put them in their bag to avoid a failing grade for the quiz, or test.**
