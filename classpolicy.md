####Project Policy

* **There is no late projects will be accepted.** I strongly suggested you submit at least one day earlier than their due dates. 
* Academic Integrity is very important. **All projects must be the original work of the student (and group if applicable) to get a proper grade for projects.**

#### Attendance Policy

**Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(2 weeks) result in a failing grade for the course.**  To excuse your absences, **a proper document with early notice** is necessary. Two late marks count as one absence. If students leave early with early notice, I will consider as one late mark.
